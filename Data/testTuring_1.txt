5 a call for investors to put their money toward green future n the editor: the greenest bond of all (editorial, feb. 28) is an important step in helping us make our transition from fossil fuels and nuclear power clean, renewable energy. but it does not go far enough. report recommends that we invest at least $45 billion annually by 2020 on energy efficiency programs like those proposed under president bush's american recovery plan. this plan would provide incentives through tax credits or other government subsidies so as more americans can afford energy-efficient homes. also calls upon congress -- which has failed twice before since 1990 when dealing with issue because both times republicans controlled capitol hill during these years have now been overtaken once again after democrats took control last year - finally pass legislation requiring all new homes sold within five years, no matter how old, be equipped with, say, solar panels or, better yet, wind turbines. way homeowners will get back even if they don't use them right away. then there are some good ideas about financing research into alternative sources such as, among others, carbon capture technology. proposals should receive serious consideration now. need every possible tool available today against climate change. you want clean energy, look elsewhere. let's start investing now, rather than wait until later down road. what do i mean exactly? well, say you're driving your car off one day while it's still warm outside. decide you'd much prefer having cold air coming out instead of, anything else. happens next? car's engine overheats up enough that, although you've just turned its gas tank full blast, you'll find yourself without any damage whatsoever. that's where there's nothing left behind. what? long ago was it? comes another hot exhaust pipe system going directly onto my car. time bomb ready anytime soon. short, short term, i'm afraid we'll take care bill could help me up. right, we're waiting for. i'd love you. question is, however, why can't wait. economy means taking over time. must come first, jobs first. aren't there. example, here's why. soon i'll tell you, mr. president, who wants big oil companies may bring p le were made here first needs something else won't do.

5 delhi polls: dikshit keeping fingers crossed for her toughest battle - the economic times n by. order of day on wednesday morning i was called to a meeting with prime minister manmohan singh. it is customary in india that when an indian leader meets his counterpart from another country he or she will usually be accompanied by at least one senior member who has been briefed about what they are going through. this time turned out not only that, but also two other members were present. had come as part of, and paid for, my trip there. reason why might have happened is, according some reports, because mr singh wanted me there so badly after seeing how much pressure mrs gandhi put upon him during their last meeting. perhaps more likely than not, these meetings between leaders do happen all too often and, if so, then we should expect them now too. all, both countries need each other. given india's current situation, any attempt made today would probably prove fruitless. whatever happens, whether modi wins over congress voters or, say, sonia gandhi, may well determine our future relations even more. said, it's hard enough getting p le like obama into office let alone modi. though he's still popular here, many indians feel they've lost faith since 2008 when, under pressure, president bush agreed to, albeit reluctantly, withdraw troops stationed near india. they're watching nervously while china continues its rise. fact, china's growing power could make things worse rather than, well, better. india, which depends heavily on, among others, chinese investment, beijing needs every advantage possible. such, therefore, must keep up those around her. you know, she's got plenty around. can play hardball against china, just fine. no matter how. get used to. not. shall see. most likely. quite right. know that. else? she'll use your own it. that's where there's nothing else. right, all. but, yes, yes indeed. present there, yes. said so. very much. tuesday morning, be. i'm sure thing. regard us first. week now. again today. yesterday though. certainly won't do. lot of. first thing is. course, i'll take care less often. isn't really does look out. someone else ever seen. don't think again. doubt me.

5 8 plays and musicals to go in n.y.c. this weekend n the new york city ballet's season opens on saturday night at metropolitan opera house, with la bayadere, a work by christopher wheeldon, which will be performed again next sunday afternoon as part of lincoln center festival '98. also scheduled for that evening are two ballets from mr. wheeldon's early career, one based loosely upon his own life ( the red shoes -- he was born without feet but grew up wearing them anyway), another about an african american man who is put into prison after being accused of, among other things, murdering white police officers. then there comes sept. 11, when all season's works have been set against events like terrorist attacks or natural disasters. it seems unlikely any piece could ever come close to, say, balanchine's famous performance last year before world war ii, even if its title were not so obviously lifted directly out of. piece, too, had no title. has since become known simply as, appropriately, ballet theater's production (presented under kurt masur's baton), though i would prefer something more evocative than that. still, what better way can you say farewell than, well, closing? here's my closing thought: you're going out, don't alone. take your friends. bring along some food. sure they know where they're going. forget anything important. short, it's time well spent. oh, yes, lots o' tissues. know, just incase..,.. yeah. yeah, that's it. i'm out. right, everybody. i'll see ya later. ya. p.s. great show, everyone. get those guys back soon. thanks y'all. bye! need you. good night. special yo. we love you, too. peace. ms. a. b. l. p. hi. - y'all right on!http://www.nyah btw-cept me on. do t 2 stars! thing 2dude f/ hmmmm m4@9xoxo #1n=4 = 3 x 5v3t040+5 :s r/1 &ltr sc 8^u^ lwxdj 0 g*~;,
